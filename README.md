# How to run the code
 
To run the code, you must first install the python dependencies found in requirements.txt with `pip install requirements.txt`. Then execute `stramlit run visual.py` in the console to display the visual interface in the browser. The datasets from `ir_datasets` and the stopwords from `nltk` will be downloaded automatically when you run the code.

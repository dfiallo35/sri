# How to run the code
 
To run the code, you must first install the python dependencies found in requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then execute `stramlit run visual.py` in the console to display the visual interface in the browser. The datasets from `ir_datasets` and the stopwords from `nltk` will be downloaded automatically when you run the code.

It is recommended before running the project to have the `cranfield` and `vaswani` datasets downloaded from `ir_dataset`. This is done by first running the code in `download_dataset.py`.
